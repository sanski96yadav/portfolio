```Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)``` was conducted on vehicle sales data using Python to support strategic decision-making.

This analysis offers a comprehensive overview of ```customer behaviour, market performance, and sales trends```.

Note:

- Sales in the analysis represent sales revenue and not order count.

The data was downloaded from Kaggle. While the data was relatively clean and smaller in scale compared to real-world business datasets, the focus extended beyond technical analysis. The analysis was approached from a business-oriented perspective by:

- Asking executive-driven questions to guide the analysis

- Performing time series analysis to uncover trends over time

- Conducting customer segmentation to identify distinct customer groups and their behaviour

- Finding meaningful insights and providing recommendations

Framework followed for the analysis:

- Requirement Gathering: EDA can be run in all directions and therefore, scope has to be decided through requirements gathering. But as this analysis was not conducted in real business set-up, the requirements gathering was done by considering executives as the audience

- Data Requirements: The analysis was mainly focused on sales revenue, and ```Sales``` column was used for it. The ```Order date``` and ```Customer Name``` column were also important columns for customer segmentation

- Aggregation and anomalies: Quick aggregations helped to understand the data. In addition, ```Univariate Analysis``` supported in knowing revenue distribution by product, spotting outliers and averages

- Dimensional aspect: ```Multi-variate Analysis```, ```Time-Series Analysis``` and ```Customer Segmentation``` were conducted for further deep dive into data

- Insights and Recommendations: Presented hidden information that will lead in creating value through supporting decision-making
