```Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)``` was conducted on vehicle sales data using Python to support strategic decision-making.

This analysis offers a comprehensive overview of ```customer behaviour, market performance, and sales trends```.

The data was downloaded from Kaggle. While the data was relatively clean and smaller in scale compared to real-world business datasets, the focus extended beyond technical analysis. The analysis was approached from a business-oriented perspective by:

- Asking executive -driven questions to guide the analysis.

- Performing time series analysis to uncover trends over time.

- Conducting customer segmentation to identify distinct customer groups and potential strategies.

Through this project, core data analysis techniques were applied but also business thinking was sharpened, translating analytical insights into potential business value. This mindset is crucial when collaborating with stakeholders and driving tangible outcomes in real-world scenarios.
