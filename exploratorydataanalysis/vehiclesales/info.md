Exploratory data analysis on vehicle sales data was carried out using Python with the aim to support strategic decision-making.

This analysis offers a comprehensive overview of customer behavior, market performance, and sales trends.

The data was downloaded from Kaggle. While the data was relatively clean and smaller in scale compared to real-world business datasets, the focus extended beyond technical analysis. I approached the project from a business-oriented perspective by:

- Asking business-relevant questions to guide the analysis.

- Performing time series analysis to uncover trends over time.

- Conducting customer segmentation to identify distinct user groups and potential strategies.

Through this project, I not only applied core data analysis techniques but also sharpened my business thinking, translating analytical insights into potential business value. This mindset is essential when working with stakeholders and driving actionable outcomes in real-world scenarios.
